# Trinity Creator #
This tool allows you to easily create items, creatures and quests for WoW emulators.
Trinity Creator can be used by beginners to learn emulator server customization and by experts who just want to do it easier and faster.

### Getting started ###
* [Download & install the latest version](https://github.com/Nadromar/TrinityCreator/blob/master/TrinityCreatorSetup/bin/Release/TrinityCreatorSetup.msi?raw=true)
* Use the top menu to select your emulator
* Enter your database info & DBC directory (optional, adds extra features)
* Start creating!
NOTE: You need to reload tables or restart your server before you can see your new creation.

### Officially supported emulators ###
* TrinityCore WotLK 3.3.5a (2020-01 database)

You can create a profile to make Trinity Creator export to almost any emulator.
There are specific fields set up for 1.12 emulators as well. But you may have issues with Cataclysm and newer versions of WoW.
You can contribute any profiles you create at [NotCoffe418/TrinityCreatorProfiles](https://github.com/NotCoffee418/TrinityCreatorProfiles).
